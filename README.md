A collaborative curation and reporting extension for Firefox.

The goal is to create an extension that allows the easy collection of interesting bits from any browseable URL that may then be fused into a coherant report/review.  For each collected tidbit, source information is remembered to allow easy return to and in-page highlighting of the original.

The extension will have three primary modes:
# Research / Resource collection;
# Collection view, organization, and collaborative commenting;
# Report / Review editor allowing easy inclusion of collected material;
